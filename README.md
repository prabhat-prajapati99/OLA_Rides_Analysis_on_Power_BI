# Problem Statement – Ride Analytics Project

The ride-hailing company OLA collects a lot of data from daily rides, payments, cancellations, vehicle types, and customer as well as driver ratings.
But this raw data is hard to understand without proper analysis.
The goal of this project is to study the ride data and find useful insights such as:
How ride bookings change over time
Which vehicle types are used the most
How revenue comes from different payment methods and customers
Why rides get cancelled by customers or drivers
How good the driver and customer ratings are
By analyzing these areas in Power BI, the project helps the company:
Increase revenue
Reduce cancellations
Improve customer satisfaction
Make better business decisions using data
In short, this dashboard turns raw ride data into clear business insights to help the company grow and improve its service.
