# Problem Statement – Ride Analytics Project

The ride-hailing company OLA collects a lot of data from daily rides, payments, cancellations, vehicle types, and customer as well as driver ratings.
But this raw data is hard to understand without proper analysis.
The goal of this project is to study the ride data and find useful insights such as:
How ride bookings change over time
Which vehicle types are used the most
How revenue comes from different payment methods and customers
Why rides get cancelled by customers or drivers
How good the driver and customer ratings are
By analyzing these areas in Power BI, the project helps the company:
Increase revenue
Reduce cancellations
Improve customer satisfaction
Make better business decisions using data
In short, this dashboard turns raw ride data into clear business insights to help the company grow and improve its service.

# Inside Summary 
Inside Summary – OLA Ride Analytics Dashboard
This project analyzes ride data from the ride-hailing company OLA using Power BI to understand overall bookings, revenue, vehicle usage, cancellations, and ratings.
The dashboard shows that the platform recorded over 1 lakh total bookings with strong total revenue generation. Ride volume remains mostly stable throughout the month, but a high cancellation rate of around 28% affects successful ride completion and overall earnings.
Vehicle-type analysis indicates that bike rides contribute the highest booking value, while other vehicle categories such as sedan, SUV, and auto maintain steady demand. Revenue insights reveal that cash and UPI are the most used payment methods, whereas card payments are very low.
Cancellation analysis highlights that rides are mainly cancelled due to driver delays, driver-initiated cancellations, and customer plan changes, showing the need for better driver management and communication.
Ratings for both drivers and customers remain close to 4.0, which indicates good but improvable service quality.
Overall, the project demonstrates how data visualization can convert raw ride data into useful business insights. These insights can help improve revenue, reduce cancellations, enhance customer experience, and support data-driven decision-making for future growth.

# Suggestion – OLA Ride Analytics

Based on the analysis of ride data from OLA, several improvements can help increase successful bookings and revenue.
First, the company should reduce ride cancellations by improving driver availability, better route matching, and clear communication between drivers and customers.
Second, since cash and UPI are the most used payment methods, digital payment offers and cashback rewards can encourage more online transactions.
Third, focusing on high-demand vehicle types like bikes and sedans can improve ride completion rate and earnings.
Fourth, maintaining high driver and customer ratings through training, support, and feedback systems will enhance overall service quality.
Finally, continuous use of data analytics and dashboards will help management take faster and smarter business decisions.
Overall, applying these suggestions can increase revenue, reduce cancellations, and improve customer satisfaction for better long-term growth.
